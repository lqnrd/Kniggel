Use `/kniggel hide/show` to toggle the main window.

Type all users you want to challenge into the textbox as a comma separated list and hit invite. Once they are all in the game, click on "Start".

Example:

Player Alice from realm Azeroth wants to play with Bob and Eve, so Alice opens the Kniggel window, and types:

the presses return to save the list.
